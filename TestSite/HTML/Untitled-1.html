<h1>This Could Be a Good Title</h1>
<p>
Love at the lips was touch
As sweet as I could bear;
And once that seemed too much;
I lived on air<br>

That crossed me from sweet things,
The flow ofâ€”was it musk
From hidden grapevine springs
Downhill at dusk?<br>

    I had the swirl and ache
From sprays of honeysuckle
That when they're gathered shake
Dew on the knuckle.<br>

    I craved strong sweets, but those
Seemed strong when I was young;
The petal of the rose
It was that stung.<br>

    Now no joy but lacks salt,
That is not dashed with pain
And weariness and fault;
I crave the stain<br> 
    Of tears, the aftermark
Of almost too much love,
The sweet of bitter bark
And burning clove.
<br>
    When stiff and sore and scarred
I take away my hand
From leaning on it hard
In grass and sand,
<br>
    The hurt is not enough:
    I long for weight and strength
    To feel the earth as rough
    To all my length.
